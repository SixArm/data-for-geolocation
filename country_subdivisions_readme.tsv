ISO 3166-2 details from Wikipedia:

ISO 3166-2 is part of the ISO 3166 standard published by 
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 
and defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions 
(e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. 

The purpose of ISO 3166-2 is to establish an international 
standard of short and unique alphanumeric codes to represent 
the relevant administrative divisions of all countries in a 
more convenient and less ambiguous form than their full names. 

Each ISO 3166-2 code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen:
The first part is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the country;
The second part is a string of up to three alphanumeric characters, 
which is usually obtained from national sources and stems from coding 
systems already in use in the country concerned, but may also be 
developed by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA) itself.

Each complete ISO 3166-2 code can then be used to uniquely identify 
a country subdivision in a global context. Currently there are more 
than 4200 codes defined in ISO 3166-2.[1]
