# Data for geolocation

Data for geolocation, countries, cities, postal codes, etc.

These are files from a project of ours, created with data we needed. 

The file format is "TSV" which is tab separated values. TSV files are easy to import into spreadsheets, databases, and to use with command-line tools like awk.
